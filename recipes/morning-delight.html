    <h2 style="text-align:center">A Delightful Morning Sugar Fix</h2>
    <p>It's Saturday morning and you're pumped for a weekend shot of pure corn syrup. Well this bad mammy jammy is the perfect remedy!</p>
    <p>Lets get started:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A box of your sweetest, most sugar-saturated cereal. I like Fruity Pebbles</li>
        <li>A half gallon of your favorite ice cream. I'm partial to vanilla, though any will work</li>
        <li>Some chunks of chocolate, or a snack cake or two, or even some chopped oreos</li>
        <li>Eight or more ounces of whole milk, or skim if you prefer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now comes the good part</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First, fill a large bowl with your cereal</li>
        <li>Then layer your toppings on top of your cereal</li>
        <li>Next, smother your bowl of goodies with milk</li>
        <li>And lastly top your bowl of goodness with a couple scoops (large ones, mind you) of your favorite ice cream.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I hope you enjoy (and survive) this massive dose of morning sugar. And please don't try this if you're diabetic!</p>
